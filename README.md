## üìù Assumptions & Limitations

- **Assumptions**:
    - The project uses **JSONPlaceholder** as a mock API for demonstration purposes.
    - The app assumes that the API will always return data in the expected format.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Mock API**: The data is fetched from a mock API (JSONPlaceholder) and not from a real backend.
    - **No Authentication**: This project does not implement authentication or authorization.

## üì° API Integration

This project integrates with [`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), which provides a mock API for posts.

- The **API** is used to fetch a list of posts and display them in the application.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is used to fetch the data before the page is rendered.
- **Infinite Scrolling** is implemented for dynamically loading more posts as the user scrolls.

### Tools and Setup
- **JSONPlaceholder API** is used to simulate fetching real-world data.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling the UI.
- **Zustand** is used for managing state across components.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle** functionality is implemented using localStorage and Zustand for theme persistence.
